# INTRODUCTION
___
Nowadays, you can find anything you want on the internet, but we never thought about the materials used and their future.

crafts have become a decorative tool at least a DIY and recycling to protect our environment.

This is how we came up with Craftiny. A social networking website that allows craft seekers to interact with each other. Not only that, it’s also a platform in which the user can share their craft and chat on. the graded and the new know-how.

# Technologies
----
# Frontend technologies

**ReactJS :** ReactJS framework is easy to use and allow us to have a responsive design thanks to its grid system. Another reason for choosing it is that it is compatible with all modern browsers.


# Backend technologies

**Python :** Among all the existing backend languages such as JAVA or PhP we decided to code with Python since it is a user-friendly and high-level programming language. We also have been working with it for some months now and find it really good.

**Flask :** We choose Flask instead of Django because it is a lightweight framework and allow us to work with the functionalities we want. We’ve been working with Flask lately and we find it really flexible and easy to use.

**Mysql :** As for the database of our website we have opted for mysql because it is compatible with all major hosting providers and is easy to manage. It is also the one which we are most comfortable working with.
